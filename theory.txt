virtualisation is the process of creation of virtual part of something rather than the real thing. eg os,server etc
best example is the partition of the harddrive 

with this we can support multiple instance of different applications that would require different architecture of the hardware on the same machine

core concept -- to enable a computing device to run multiple indepependet systems at the same time
this thing reduces the number of devices to fewer devices with multiple support


HYPERVISOR
it is a piece of computer software , firmware that creates and runs virtual machines
the main purpose is to act as a black box to abstract the underlying hardware from the softwares running on top of it
use mem mgmt.
also known as virtual machine monitor



virtualisation and cloud computing are used together to build the public or private cloud infra.

the physical cpu is abstracteed into virtual cpu, the time is shared between different processes

virtual cpu
virtual memory
